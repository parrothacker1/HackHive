# Contributing to HackHive 
Thank you for considering to contribute to this project! 🎉 Your efforts, whether small or large, help improve this project and make it more robust. Below I have mentioned where we really need contributions. The rest of the area is kind of sorted, but I would welcome any helping hand and even suggestions to improve at some place would be really appreciated. 😊

## How You Can Contribute 
We welcome contributions in various forms, but here are some areas where your help would make a significant impact:
* ### 🛠️ Admin Interface
    * Once the admin backend is developed, we would greatly appreciate contributions toward designing and developing a user-friendly admin interface.
    * If you have experience with frontend frameworks or admin dashboards, this is a great way to contribute!
* ### 🎨 Logo Design
    * We are looking for a unique and meaningful logo for this project. If you have design skills, we'd love to see your ideas!
* ### 🤝 General Contributions
    * As I previously mentioned, the rest of the services are sorted, but I would appreciate any sort of improvements, optimizations and such. If you see something that could be better, feel free to jump in!

## Getting Started 
### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the repository and create a branch from the dedicated branch (right now it's just `main` branch but we plan to divide into branches based on the CTF type).
```
git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
```

### 2. Setup the Environment
Follow the  `README` file to setup the environment locally.Just before you start hacking, just make a initial run to make sure everything runs smoothly.

### 3. Make your changes
Add your contribution, write meaningful commit messages(helpful for us to understand what it does.I know mine's messed up but I am also trying to fix it), and ensure your code passes existing tests.

### 4. Write tests
If applicable, write tests for your changes to ensure reliability and stability.

### 5. Create a Pull Request
Submit a pull request to the respective branch. Clearly describe the changes you made and include any relevant context.
